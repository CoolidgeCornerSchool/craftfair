# Craft Fair: Tips for Success  

1. **Don’t make too much.**  
It is better to sell most of what you have than to go home with a lot of unsold crafts.
Also, all crafters will sharing tables with other crafters.  Make sure you can display
your craft, or at least a few examples of your craft, on half of a table.

2. **Keep it inexpensive.  And bring change.**  
Most of your customers are other kids. Items between 50¢ and $2 do better than items
$3 and over.  Have plenty of $1 bills and quarters with you to make change for your customers. 

3. **Do something different.**  
If you make an item that may be similar to other crafter’s items, think of a creative way to
make yours different from the usual. 

4. **It’s not a bake sale.**  
Baked items are fine if that’s what you really want to do, but remember that the emphasis of the fair is on crafts and services.  

5. **Make it fun for customers.**  
Consider offering a service at the fair so kids have something to do while they’re there. Face painting, nails, tattoos, and hair accessorizing are just some of the possibilities. 

6. **Trade.**  
If you end up with too much stuff that you haven’t sold, try trading with other kids for their products. 

7. **Keep your group small.**  
Crafters will be sharing a table with other crafters.  Keep your group small so you can all help with the display.

8. **Make your display creative.**  
You’ll attract more customers if you have a creative way to display your items than just laying them on the table. 

9. **Have fun!**
